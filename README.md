**RentFuse** is a decentralized smart contract system designed to revolutionize real estate leasing. It automates critical rental processes—such as rent collection, security deposits, late fee enforcement, and lease termination—allowing landlords and tenants to interact transparently and securely without intermediaries.

By bringing rental agreements on-chain, RentFuse ensures trustless, immutable, and tamper-proof records of all leasing activities.

## 🧱 Smart Contract Architecture

- **Landlord Role:** 
  - Deploys contract.

- **Tenant Role:** 
  - Signs the lease.
  - Pays rent and deposits via the contract.
- **State Transitions:** 
  - `Initiated` → `Active` → `Terminated` or `Breached`
